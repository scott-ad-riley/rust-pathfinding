# TODO: The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by
# logging them with `console.error`. This is great for development, but requires
# all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking` infrastructure, so ideally we'd only use
# it in debug mode, however [target."cfg(debug_assertions)".dependencies] does not
#Â work - so in the meantime, we're always including it
# see issues for more/possible solutions in future:
